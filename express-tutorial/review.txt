What is Express.js
------------------

Writing all the server side logic is complex and time consuming.
Express allows you to use third party packages to hooked in and helps us focus on our applications.
We use a framework for this heavy lifting. Framework is full of helper function and tools that help us build things.

Alternatives to Express.js:
1. Vanilla Node.js
2. Adonis.js
3. Koa
4. Sails.js

Express is by far most popular and most useful. It is highly flexible and minimalist. Gives you core functionality out of the box without making
the application clunky. 

Using MiddleWare
----------------

Express is all about MiddleWare. MiddleWare is functions that a request goes through before coming to a response.
Allows better abstraction and plug nature.
