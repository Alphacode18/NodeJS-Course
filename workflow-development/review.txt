NPM: Node Packet Manager 
------------------------

NPM allows us to install third party package. The NPM creates a json package.
JSON is JavaScript Object Notation, that has key value pairs in strings. JSON is used as a configuration file.
The NPM made JSON package has scripts object, which holds commands.

Example: npm start (For this project) //start is a special name
If the script name is custom, you have to use npm run start-server.

Third party packages are used to add utilities to your project without re-inventing the wheel.
All such packages live in NPM's cloud. We can use NPM to retrieve those projects.

Installing Packages Using NPM
------------------------------

npm install {packageName} is generally used to install packages. But we use different options while installing different packages.

Example: Nodemon is a dynamic server development package but is only used for development and not actually in production.
Thus, we would do: npm install nodemon --save-dev

While, a fully production based package would be installed as:
npm install express --save

We can also do a npm install node -g (This installs the package globally).

npm install (Updates all packages)

To save space you can delete node modules to work, but then you can re-run npm install to get all dependencies back.

package-lock.json consists of the current versions installed and working.
