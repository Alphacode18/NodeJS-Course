Templating Engine
-----------------

A templating engine uses an HTMLish template which has all your HTML page format with blanks. Think of a story with Fill in The blanks.
It then goes through the Node/Express content and then replaces place holder and snippets with real HTML content.
This content is generated on the fly by the server basing on the dynamic content.
Then the template is filled and HTML is sent to the user after generation on the fly.
