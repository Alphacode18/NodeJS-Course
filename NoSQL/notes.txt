What is MongoDB
---------------

- MongoDB is a company and also the name of their most famous product.
- Mongo is short for Humongous implying and proving that it works best with large data sets.

How it works
------------

- MongoDB has its own server just like SQL.
- MongoDB is schemaless. Thus documents don't need to have same structure.
- You have a database for say shop.
- For tables, it has collections (Users, Products) and for rows it has documents.
- MongoDB uses JSON to depict data, but it actually uses BSON (Binary JSON) - transforms to binary behind the scenes.
- Here, you can have nested (or embedded) JavaScript Objects. (Relations are managed differently)
- Heavily uses duplicate data where a document in a collection would use full/part of a document in another collection as embedded object.
